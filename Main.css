					<h2> What is Mutual Aid? </h2>
					   <style>
                           Section {
                               display:flex;

			<p> Mutual aid is a solidarity-based support where communities unite against a common struggle. They take on the responsibility of caring for each other, rather than leaving individuals to fend for themselves. Aid is offered in a spirit of solidarity and reciprocity, with a larger aim towards liberation and progress for all.</p>
			
			<p>In a mutual aid model, there are no conditions on who receives help and everyone is seen as equal, with people working cooperatively to meet the needs of all within a community. In essence, charity responds to the effects of inequality, while mutual aid seeks to both meet materials need and address root causes. </p>
